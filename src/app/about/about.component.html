        <p class="about">We believe in a future of real estate where everyone has a great experience in finding what they’re looking for. It should be as simple as a click of a button to put time, energy, and resources back into peoples’ hands, making it so that the search is the easiest part of the property purchase or rental process.

              <p class="a-head">Our mission is to make the agent-to-client dynamic more authentic, human, and real by encouraging the agent to reach out to the client. In doing so, we shift the focus from the listing, to the connection that takes place between people. We believe that the real estate dynamic should be about people working together to find what they need.

        <p class="p-para">Innovate the NYC real estate search to return time, energy, and effort to real estate agents and clients.

          The idea for SpotLeads originated when founder Sivan Aharon was experiencing the painful and drawn-out process of finding an NYC apartment. After spending a frustrating number of hours searching for a place, SpotLeads was born with the conclusion that clients simply shouldn’t be playing the role of a real estate agent.

          We believe that our client users have enough to worry about for their upcoming move—and that they can’t afford to endlessly scroll for hours on end.

          Our ”why” is to offer a platform that takes this burden off the client, allowing the professionals to do what they are here to do.
